    <h2>Spaghetti</h2>
    <p>The super flavorful spaghetti sauce is ready in 45 minutes and you can use your favorite
         ground meat to make it (beef, turkey, and chicken are all excellent).
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Ground meat</li>
        <li>Tomatoes and tomato paste</li>
        <li>Onion, garlic, and spices</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make the Best Spaghetti</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            You’ll start by making the easy meat sauce. Brown your meat in a bit of oil, and then stir in onions until they soften. Then add lots of flavor with garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes. To finish the sauce, add a bit of water (or broth) and crushed tomatoes. Our easy sauce simmers for about 25 minutes, so about 15 minutes before it is ready, you can cook your spaghetti.

            For the best spaghetti, cook it in salted water. Pasta water should taste salty. I add a lot of salt to our pasta water (it makes the pasta taste delicious). I add about one tablespoon of salt for every four quarts (16 cups) of water, which is perfect for cooking one pound of pasta.
        </li>

            There’s no need to rinse spaghetti after cooking, especially if you plan to toss it with a sauce. Rinsing removes the starch, which helps our sauce cling to the noodles. My only caveat to this is when I’m making cold pasta dishes, like pasta salad or macaroni salad.
        </li>

            When your spaghetti is ready, toss it with your delicious homemade meat sauce and serve with some parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Yum!
