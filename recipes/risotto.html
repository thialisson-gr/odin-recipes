    <h2>Classic Recipe</h2>
    <p>
        This is our go-to recipe for homemade Risotto. 
        It is a classic Italian side dish with short-grain rice cooked in stock until it’s creamy. Adding parmesan makes it cheesy, decadent, and irresistible. 
        Homemade Risotto is probably the most impressive method for cooking rice.

    <h2>How to Make Risotto</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the stock – In a separate large saucepan, heat your chicken stock to a simmer then reduce to the lowest heat just to keep it very hot without boiling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook aromatics – in a heavy pot or dutch oven over medium-low heat, add butter and oil, and sautee onions with salt, stirring with a spatula until softened (do not brown the onions). Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toast rice – add rice, increase to medium heat, and stir for about 3 minutes until the rice is toasted and starting to look translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add white wine – stir in the white wine and continue stirring for 2 minutes or until mostly evaporated. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Add stock – using a ladle, add one ladle-full at a time and continue stirring until absorbed before adding another ladle-full. Continue this process until the rice reaches your desired doneness. This takes 20-25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add-ins – add the remaining butter and parmesan cheese then season to taste with salt if needed and serve garnished with more cheese and freshly cracked black pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>
