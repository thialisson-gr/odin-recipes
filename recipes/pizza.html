    <h2>How to prepare the pizza</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The first step in this margherita pizza recipe is preparing the tomato sauce.
            Place the canned tomatoes and their juices, olive oil, garlic, and salt in a food processor. Blend until smooth.

        <li>
            Next, stretch the dough. Don’t worry if you don’t have any fancy pizza-making equipment like a pizza peel or pizza stone. 
            A baking sheet works perfectly for this recipe!
        </li>
        <li>
            Then, add the toppings. 
            Spread a heaping 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce over the pizza dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges.
        </li>
        <li>
            …and bake! Transfer the pizza to a 500°F oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden brown.
            Remove the pizza from the oven and top it with the fresh basil leaves, red pepper flakes, and a drizzle of olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice and serve. That’s it!
        </li>
    </ol>
